Main Hall
%
The ceilling of this entrance hall is high above and everything has been 
designed to inspire wonder.  The floor is scuffed from the footsteps of many 
wanderers.

Bar
%
Refuge for all weary travellers! The floor is sticky from the dried spillages, 
and despite the no smoking signs there is a heaviness to the air made more 
oppressive by the lack of windows.

Games Room
%
Not a quiet escape from the bar in any sense.  Beeps and flashing lights 
surround you.  Why do people throw their money into these things?

Walk-in Wardrobe
%
The clothes store of a serious shop-a-holic.  There are enough dresses, tops 
and trousers here to clothe a nation.  And as for shoes, well there is a 
battered pair of Doc Martin boots, but the rest look unworn.

Bedroom
%
Mind where you step - this place is a mess.  Clothes lie all over the floor 
and the bed looks like it is about to disintegrate.  A green fluffy rabbit
sits on the dresser and doesn't fit with the rest of the feel of the room.

Attic
%
Creaky stairs lead up to this dusty space.  Piles of forgotten books and toys 
are scattered around covered in cobwebs. A place of memories.

Upstairs

A sweeping staircase leads up from the hall and into the privacy of the 
personal rooms.

Balcony
%
This grandiose piece of architecture hangs directly over the ornamental 
gardens. It is easy to see how people fantasise about climbing up to sneak 
that last kiss from their beloved.

Gardens
%
Any gardener would be proud to have designed this spectacular show of colour 
and scent.  The exquisite perfume of the roses almost coompletely covers the
stench of the fertiliser.

Lake
%
A shimmering mass of muddy green water lies ahead. There are a few possible 
paths around the edge, but you will have to tread carefully.

Stepping Stones

Tread carefully! One missed footing and you could end up in the lake.  There 
is no way of knowing how deep the water is here.

Kitchen
%
Pots and pans overflow the sink and are stacked high on the floor.  The 
washing up is obviously not a high priority or else this has been one hell
of a special meal...

Driveway
%
The outside of the main house is covered in ivy and looks as if it might fall  
down at any point. A small fountain trickles ineffectively on the lawn.

Garage
%
Not used for housing a car, but rather all the junk that couldn't be stuffed 
into the attic, and this is the reaally grotty stuff. Oil and paint lies on 
the floor in puddles.

Wood
%
The trees are close around you and the ground is damp.  The sunlight is 
mostly obscured by the canopy and it is easy to become disoriented.

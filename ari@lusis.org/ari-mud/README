Usage:
./mud [<port>]

If no port is specified, 4201 will be used.

When you connect, you will be given two choices. 'cn' connects you to an
existing player, while 'cr' creates one and connects you to it.  You may
connect to any player only one time concurrently.  After you connect,
you are presented with the description of your location.  Several commands
are available to every player:
who	Gives list of online players
look	Shows description of current location
go <e>	Goes in the direction of a certain exit, whose entire name must be given
say <t>	Speaks the given text to the players in your location
pose <t>	Poses the given text to the players in your location
hit <p>	Hits the selected player and displays how much damage you did
stat	Displays your hit points.

Several other commands are only available to wizards.  The only player that
is created by the program at runtime is 'God' (password 'Ari'), who is a
wizard that can be used to expand the MUD or maintain it while it is running.
wiz <p>	Give wizard privelages to the selected player
dewiz <p>	Revoke wizard privelages
ann <t>	Announces the text to the entire MUD
heal <p>	Heals the player to 100 hit points.
kill <p>	Kills the player
dig <r>	Creates a new room, linked to your present location
desc <t>	Gives the current location the description you want
nuke	Destroys the current room and moves all players in it to the home room
tel <r>	Teleports to a selected room


Several sample rooms are included with the program, and these are created
automatically at runtime.  Players will start on the outskirts of a small
town.

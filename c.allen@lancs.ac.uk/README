RUNNING
=======

Crappotalk will work with tcl 8.0 and 8.2.  To run it, edit the 'startup'
script, replacing tclsh8.0 with the name (and if necessary path) of your
tclsh interpreter.  Then:

  ./startup

Logs will be kept in log/log-date.

If you want to edit the mantras, questions or starting nouns, edit the files
mantra, noun and questions.

User files are stored in users/Name, passwords are unencrypted.  For more
detailed user documentation, see the file user.ps.

Crappotalk's homepage is at:  http://penguin.lancs.ac.uk/crappotalk/ and it
should be running at penguin.lancs.ac.uk port 1234 (provided someone hasn't
rebooted the machine while I'm away or run the shutdown command as Zoia).

The file 'doc/output' contains the results of running the 16k.py script on
the talker's source and data files.

Features of Borlak's 16kbyte MiniMud!
-------------------------------------
Efficient memory handling:  Memory is recycled by the use of free 
linked lists.

"Crash-Proof":  Nothing is crash proof, but I did my best to prevent 
them.  First off by making macros for my memory handling that
 automatically removes/adds/maintains a memory recycling structure.  
No accidental screw ups!  Also my allocation of strings is carefully 
checked to make sure that no memory is left floating in space and never 
deleted.

Easy to handle code:  I made the file names obvious, the .h files are 
nicely split up to find what you need fast.  The code in general has 
the same design.  No fancy pants code that you have to spend a while to 
figure out.

Dynamic pfiles:  Pfiles aren't saved as binary but as an extendable 
(MERC'ish) format.

Error logging:  I didn't skimp on error logging ;-)  And oh yeah, I 
have logging ;-)

Crypted passwords: ...

Chat room:  I first made a really weak fighting system, but it was just 
so lame and no fun that I decided to just keep a general chat room.  In 
fact, this may not be a mud at all, but a chat server :)

Simple sockets: Take a look for yourself!

Lack of features
----------------
No wizards.

No combat.

No OLC, rooms, mobs, objects.

Bad sleep system.  Mud loops once a second.


Personal Summary
----------------
It's not fun, unless you like to chat!  I had a combat system, but 
removed it.  I decided I wanted a base that others could work off of.  
I want to help the mud community.  So I have a basic "MERC"ish design 
that I think many people will feel comfortable with and will be able 
to easily build off of.  From my testing, it's completely stable, and 
there are no bugs.  My code looks very much like MERC, because I've
spent 6 years working only on MERC muds :)

<p><font size=+1>Introduction:</font>
<br>My goal here was not to create the ideal server, but rather to implement
a complete playable game, ignoring the ideal server aspects of it (saving
files, logging in, reconnecting).&nbsp; My guess as to how much space my
desired features would take, as it turns out, was some 500-700 bytes over
the limit, but I was able to condense it down to a legal size (according
to the 16k.py filesize checker) with a few snips of strings and some changes
in the variable names.
<p>What exists in this implementation is a multi-user server, that will
accept connections, create a ship for the user, who can then trade and
battle as he sees fit, until sucked into a black hole or destroyed by one
of his opponents.&nbsp; Just to make death more painful, link to the server
is cut upon your destruction.
<p>The code itself is just under 16k in size, and is implemented in <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a>.&nbsp;
I have been able to successfully run it both on my windows machine and
on a *nix account as well, without any internal changes whatsoever.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><font size=+1>Features:</font>
<br>-Generated world (approximately 1000 sectors), divided into 3 main
zones:&nbsp; the core, the outer worlds, and the nebula beyond.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Planets
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Each planet has its own
prices for various ore.&nbsp; By trading between them, players can generate
revenue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Stars
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -stars do not currently
have much importance (other than determining where a planet can exist.)&nbsp;
I had planned to have stars influence regeneration rates and visibility,
which may appear once I am no longer working within the 16k barrier.
<p>-ansi color
<br>-basic combat system
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -direct launching of torpedos against opposing vessels
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the ability to lay mines to block in opponents
and place hazards along easy trade routes.
<br>-basic trade system
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -three types of ore that are traded planet to planet.&nbsp;
Financial success allows for ship upgrades.
<br>-movement
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -'Wormgates' tie star systems together.&nbsp; They
grow more chaotic as one travels further from the galactic core.
<br>-regeneration
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Ships regain 1 unit of fuel and 1 unit of hp every
realtime second.

<br><font size=+1>Commands:</font>
<br>(each command can be abbreviated however you choose, as long as the
first letter remains intact.)
<p><b><font color="#000066">look</font></b>
<br>Show the contents of the current sector, including wormgates, planets,
and other ships.&nbsp; This command is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b>
to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">enter</font></b>
<br>Move from one sector to another via a wormgate.&nbsp; This command
requires an argument: the number of the wormgate which you wish to enter.&nbsp;
Each use of this command consumes <b><font color="#FF0000">15 </font></b>units
of fuel.
<p><b><font color="#000066">radio</font></b>
<br>The radio command forms a global channel with which to communicate
with other players.&nbsp; This command is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b>
to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">?</font></b>
<br>This command displays your information, including the contents of your
cargo holds, your fuel and your ship's remaining health.&nbsp; This command
is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b> to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">name</font></b>
<br>This command allows you to recommision your ship under a different
name.&nbsp; This command is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b> to
use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">dock</font></b>
<br>This command must be used to dock with a planet's space station in
order to conduct trade.&nbsp; While you are docked, you cannot move or
commit any hostile acts.&nbsp; To leave the station, use the dock command
a second time.&nbsp; This command costs <b><font color="#FF0000">10 </font></b>units
of fuel per every use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">quit</font></b>
<br>This command performs a self-destruct, and closes your connection.&nbsp;
You currently cannot save your progress.
<p><b><font color="#000066">viewer</font></b>
<br>This command performs a detailed scan of nearby space, revealing the
location and status of your opponents.&nbsp; This command consumes <b><font color="#FF0000">50</font></b>
units of fuel every time it is used.&nbsp; Use of this scan is detectable
throughout known space.
<p><b><font color="#000066">who</font></b>
<br>This command returns a list of players currently connected to the game,
their numerical IP's, and the number of seconds they have been online.&nbsp;
This command is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b> to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">buy</font></b>
<br>This command, while docked, allows you to purchase ore.&nbsp; The syntax
is, for example, 'buy ore1 100' to purchase 100 units of ore1.&nbsp; Also,
via the syntax 'buy ship', you can purchase an upgrade, which will increase
your capabilities.&nbsp; This command is <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b>
to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">sell</font></b>
<br>Similar in style to the 'buy' command, the sell command allows you
to sell the contents of your holds.&nbsp; This command is likewise <b><font color="#FF0000">free</font></b>
to use.
<p><b><font color="#000066">torpedo</font></b>
<br>Allows you to fire a torpedo at an opposing ship.&nbsp; Be warned,
however, as each torpedo consumes <b><font color="#FF0000">500</font></b>
units of fuel, and you may not be able to limp away before your opponent
responds in kind.&nbsp; Currently, you cannot abbreviate your target's
name, and it is case-sensitive.
<p><b><font color="#000066">mine</font></b>
<br>Allows you to deploy a subspace mine into a specific wormgate, where
it will lurk and detonate against the hull of the next ship to pass through.&nbsp;
Each deployed mine consumes <b><font color="#FF0000">200 </font></b>units
of fuel.
